# Documentation

First of all we wanted to started to implement everything as easy as posible. The first we did was to develop was the train schedual calss so we would know where the train would be at a spesific time. After that we started to do the train calss so you could select witch train would drive a spesific route. The ORM we have is simple now in the beginning so we get all things working together.

The first row in the picture is just a startstation and endstation, the second row is startstation and endstation with two stations in between. It's basic in the beginning so all things work together, when we get all to work we will extend the functionallity of the ORM with level crossings and railroad switches.

Simulating the train ride we did with just printing out at what station the train is at and what departure time it had and what the next station are with the arrival time.
