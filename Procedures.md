# Project 2 - Procedures
In this second project should you be working with what have been discussed regarding OOP, Fluent APIs, threads and ORM.

You should work in groups of 3 to 4 students.

In the end is your group going to do present (a mini-presentation) the key points of you solution. And the rest of the class will give a points for the solution.

Work with mob programming, one driver, 10 min per driver-

Everybody in the group is driver on turn. The last thing the drives does before leaving the keyboard to the next driver is to perform a commit and push of the code to GitHub.

## Team

The team consist of 3 to 4 persons, with the following roles:

- **Driver**, the one sitting in front of the computer, and the only one using the keyboard and mouse.
- **Spy**, when signal is given should this person spy on another team
- **Timekeeper**, has a stopwatch and makes sure the team switch places as close to 10 min as possible and that the spy only spies the allowed time
- **Co-driver** (only for teams of four), everybody is in theory co-drivers and helps the driver. The term is taken from Rally where the co-driver keeps track on the track and the driver is responsible of steering the car.

The team rotate roles every 10 minutes, following this pattern:

* Spy becomes Driver
* Timekeeper becomes Spy
* Driver becomes Timekeeper, in case of four team members will the Driver become co-driver, and the co-driver become Timekeeper.

The timing is important as the team will retrieve penalty points for late or early rotation (measured on the git commit/push).

## Spying

When the signal is given should all spys go to a driver to learn about the solution by another team. Only the driver is allowed to talk with the spy and answer all the spy's questions. The total spy session from signal is given is **only** 45 seconds! And it's the mater of the timekeeper to cut of the spy.

A hint is to plan the spying: which team are we spying at? what are we looking for?

The result of the spying is a comment in the code like this:

```C#
// Spy: @GitHub-username, a short desciption of findings
```

## Mini-presentation of the project

On **Wednesday 17th of March 9:30**, will each group do a mini presentation. You should long before the presentation have made decision in the group who is going to do the talking.

Be sharp you only have **5 min** including attaching your computer.

The rest of class will give a vote on paper, scale is 1-5, this vote is placed into the hat of the group.

### When voting

Remember to write the group you are voting on and your own group on the voting paper. Otherwise is the vote considered invalid.

Look for the following in the presentation:

- Code
- Tests
- Patterns
- Readiness
- Presentation

- Timing
